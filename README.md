# README

This app is me trying to use Angular.js with a framework I am already familiar with, RoR.

## Requirements:	

* Phone with a vibration sensor

* Android ICS(4.0) / iOS 6 or later

* Mozilla Broswer for your phone!! App will not work without it, as it runs off Mozilla APIs


## This app will have: 

* A countdown/count up timer to keep track of time played and extra time

* List of players on the pitch, and their kit numbers (sanctions done here)

* Ability to page the referee by other match official through vibrations

* Sanction players and record goals, etc and the time they were scored
